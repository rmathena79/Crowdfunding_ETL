# Crowdfunding_ETL
Data Analytics Boot Camp Project 2

## Contents
My solutions:
- **ETL_Mini_Project_RMathena.ipynb**: My solution to notebook portions of the project
- **Resources\*.csv**: Transformed data files, generated by my notebook
- **crowdfunding_db_schema.sql**: Database schema based on the cleaned and transformed data

These files were provided with the project assignment:
- **Resources\*.xlsx**: Input data files provided
- **ETL_Mini_Project_Starter_Code.ipynb**: Starter notebook provided


## Instructions
To recreate the data transformation, load the ETL_Mini_Project_RMathena.ipynb notebook and run all cells.

To check the database structure, create a database and run the commands from crowdfunding_db_schema.sql to create tables. Then import the CSVs in the same order as the tables in the schema file.


## Notes
The Starter notebook incorrectly says to use 'header=2' when reading contacts.xlsx. It needs to be 'header=3'.
